# Finding the right words: a computational model of cued lexical retrieval
This repository contains the data and analysis scripts for the methods and analyses reported in the paper titled "Finding the right words: a computational model of cued lexical retrieval" published in the Proceedings of the 44th Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society.

In the Jupyter notebook (which contains a link to open in Colab), you can find all of the code to used to run and analyze the models. The files with our data outputs are imported first, so you have the option for any part to run all the code for yourself or run the line included that reads in the necessary file. The notebook includes precomputing the vector representations of our descriptions and vocabulary words, calculating the negative log-likelihoods of each response in the behavioral data for each of the 13 models, and analyzing model performances overall and broken down by group.

In the Rmd notebook, you can find the code used to create the figures in the paper.
